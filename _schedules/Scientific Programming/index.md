# Scientific Programming / Data Processing

## Syllabus Fall 2023/2024

Welcome to this programming track! In the weeks ahead, you’ll use the Python programming language while learning to solve scientific problems from several fields of science. This track is intended for students who have no experience in programming at all. It comprises three courses, Scientific Programming 1, Scientific Programming 2 and Data Processing wherein you learn about the Python language by working on programming problems from several scientific areas.

### Course materials

All the reading and video material is available on this website. You do not need to purchase any books or software. Every module consists of short explanations (written and in the form of videos) and assignments. _You do need to bring your own laptop._

### Staff

Milena Kapralova, Amir Sahrani, Roan van Blanken, Simon Pauw

### Getting started

Your entry to the course is the sidebar, where you can leaf through all modules (levels) that you have to complete. To get started:

- Read the rest of the syllabus, below.
- Install Python.
- Choose one of the level 1 modules (Algorithms or Numbers) to get started!

Beware that these are all the modules for all the Scientific Programming courses! **Don't start making them all until you've read below which specific modules you need to do for the course you are following.**

### The track

The Scientific Programming track consists of three courses:

- Scientific Programming 1 (3 EC, not graded but pass/fail).
- Scientific Programming 2 (3 EC, not graded but pass/fail).
- Data Processing (6 EC, graded).

You can follow each course at different paces to fit your schedule. You don't have to follow the entire track, you can also follow a single course. If you already have some programming experience and would like to skip the first (two) course(s), please contact us.

Course specific information can be found further down.

### Structure

The track is designed to be very flexible. So, there are no compulsory sessions. There are no lectures (except for a kick-off meeting at the start of Scientific Programming 1) and the tutorials are optional. And, you can follow the courses at any pace that fits your schedule.

### Help

The fact that the track is flexible doesn't mean you are on you own. We do provide a lot of help throughout the course with the programming assignments. It is up to you to seek out this help.

There are two ways to get help, the tutorials and the forum:

- Tutorials (on campus): The tutorials are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You’ll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you’re working on your assignments.
  - **We highly recommend to join at least one tutorial a week.**
  - You can find the tutorial schedule here: [datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[119429])
  - This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
  - This is the main place where you can meet other students.
  - If you can not make it to the tutorial you can book an appointment to get online help during the sessions.
    - Book an appointment here: [link]
    - At the moment of your appointment you can join here: [zoom](https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/87393415014)
- Forum (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.
  - Use the forum: [link]
  - If you are registered for Scientific Programming 1 you should automatically have access to the forum. If not, please send and email to get access.

### Programming modules

You're going to learn programming through a number of programming modules. Each module consist of:

- Theory: Explanations both written and in the form of video's.
- Practice: Exercises to test your understanding of the theory.
- Assignments: Bigger programming problems, that require combining multiple programming concepts.

The modules are grouped into levels, you have to make one module per level. For some levels you have the choice between two different modules. When there is such a choice, you will learn the same programming concepts, but often in different thematic context (i.e. different scientific field).

Here below is an overview of all modules for all courses.

#### Scientific Programming 1 (Level 1 - Level 3)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Level 0 </td><td colspan="3"> Python Installation </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 1</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>ALGORITHMS</b>. Learn to think like a computer. Things that we intuitively know how to do, like drawing a pyramid or computing change for a payment, is hard to get a computer to do right. In this module you’ll learn how to break down such intuitive problems into steps that even a computer can understand.
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMBERS</b>. How do you know if a number is a prime number? Number theory is the science about properties of numbers. In this mathematically oriented module you create a series of programs that compute this and other properties of numbers. No math knowledge required for this module. (You will learn some, though)
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 2</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>TEXT</b>. Natural language processing is the science of making a computer understand (something about) natural human language. You will learn how you can get a computer to understand the sentiment of tweets. Is the tone of the tweet positive or negative?
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMERICAL INTEGRATION</b>. In many scientific fields you need to determine the surface area under a function. Integration is a mathematical tool for doing so. However this tool doesn't always work and in such cases we can use numerical integration techniques to let the computer do the work for us. You will learn two important techniques for numerical integration.
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 3</b> (no choice)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>BIG-DATA</b>. In this module you will learn to work with data. You will, for example, analyze weather from the Netherlands and answer questions like: When was the first heat-wave? What was the longest freezing period? </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Bonus</b> (this module is optional)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>MOVEMENT</b>. What happens if you dig a tunnel from one side to the other side of the planet and you fall in this tunnel? In this module you’re going to simulate that situation. In physics you often run into problems that are too laborious to compute by hand. In this module you’ll learn how to use your computer instead. </td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Scientific Programming 2 (Level 4 - Level 6)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Level 4</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>MONOPOLY</b>. When playing Monopoly, a starting player's advantage seems unfair. To verify, you could play many (millions) real games, but this would take way too much time. Instead, you'll write a computer simulation. This also allows you to experiment with game adjustments to make it fair. You're doing all this for a board game, but this simulation principle applies to various scientific fields (economy, chemistry, biology...).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 5</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>COMPLEXITY</b>. What is an efficient algorithm? When you want to run large simulations, analyze large dataset, or any other computationally intensive task, writing efficient algorithms could in some cases mean the difference between a run time of a couple of minutes or of weeks. The theory of computational complexity gives you a way to reason about the efficiency of algorithms and make them run (much) faster.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 6</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>SURVIVAL</b>. Python is very popular for analyzing and processing data. And Pandas is an important reason why. Pandas is the most used Python package for handling data. You will learn how to use this package to analyze and visualize geographical data.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Data Processing (Level 7 - Level 11)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Level 7</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>POPULATIONS</b>. Predator-prey simulations are models used in ecology and computer science to study the dynamics between populations of predators and their prey within an ecosystem. What's particularly interesting about these simulations is how they can reveal emergent patterns and complex behaviors that arise from relatively simple rules. Ta make it easier to program such a simulation you will learn a programming technique called object oriented programming (OOP).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 8</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>ACQUISITION</b>. What was the best year for movies? This is often debated on the internet, for example [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/12/28/feature/what-was-the-best-year-in-movie-history/), [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/film-history-best-year-1999-star-wars-matrix-fight-club-sixth-sense-a9036911.html), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5m6jrp/best_year_for_movies/) and [here](https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/10-movies-prove-1994-was-best-year-film-history). You're going to write a bot that extracts information from websites to find an answer to this question. This process is called web-scraping. When you're doing research it's often the case that the data is out there on the internet, but no-one went through the effort to collect for you in way that you can directly use it. In that case you will need to know how to acquire this data yourself. </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 9</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>TRANSFORMATION</b>. Does a restaurant pass health code inspections? Could you gauge this by analyzing reviews of this restaurant? You will use information from two different data sources (Yelp and the Washington State Department of Health) to answer these questions. The problem is (as you will see quite often when analyzing data), there is no straightforward way to combine the two data sources. They were never made to be used together, so you will need to transform the datasets to be used together.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 10</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>DATABASES</b>. When working with really large amounts of data, you typically wont store it in simple (text) files on your computer. You'd use something like a relational database. To get information from a database you'll need a specific language called Structured Query Language (SQL). You're going to practice SQL by solving a mystery... </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 11</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>FINAL PROJECT</b>. Do you have data from your own studies or research that you would like to analyze? Do this with our help for the final project of this course. The goal here is to work on something that you find interesting and care about. </td>
  </tr>

## Dates and deadlines

### Deadlines

Deadlines for each level are listed below. The deadlines are our recommendation. If you follow these deadlines you'll have all the assignments finished in time for the corresponding examination moment. You can occasionally diverge a bit from the deadlines, but if you notice that you're structurally behind please contact us.

The deadlines depend on the period in which you start the course (1, or 2) and at what pace you're following it (relaxed - finish SP1 and SP2 in one year, standard - finish all courses in one year, fast - finish all courses in one semester). Most students tend to follow the standard schedule, which corresponds to an investment of about 10 hrs/wk.
