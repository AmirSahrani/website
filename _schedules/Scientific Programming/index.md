# Scientific Programming



## Levels

### Scientific Programming 1 (Level 1 - Level 3)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Level 0 </td><td colspan="3"> Python Installation </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 1</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>ALGORITHMS</b>. Learn to think like a computer. Things that we intuitively know how to do, like drawing a pyramid or computing change for a payment, is hard to get a computer to do right. In this module you’ll learn how to break down such intuitive problems into steps that even a computer can understand.
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMBERS</b>. How do you know if a number is a prime number? Number theory is the science about properties of numbers. In this mathematically oriented module you create a series of programs that compute this and other properties of numbers. No math knowledge required for this module. (You will learn some, though)
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 2</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>TEXT</b>. Natural language processing is the science of making a computer understand (something about) natural human language. You will learn how you can get a computer to understand the sentiment of tweets. Is the tone of the tweet positive or negative?
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMERICAL INTEGRATION</b>. In many scientific fields you need to determine the surface area under a function. Integration is a mathematical tool for doing so. However this tool doesn't always work and in such cases we can use numerical integration techniques to let the computer do the work for us. You will learn two important techniques for numerical integration.

  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 3</b> (no choice)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>BIG-DATA</b>. In this module you will learn to work with data. You will, for example, analyze weather from the Netherlands and answer questions like: When was the first heat-wave? What was the longest freezing period? </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Bonus</b> (this module is optional)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>MOVEMENT</b>. What happens if you dig a tunnel from one side to the other side of the planet and you fall in this tunnel? In this module you’re going to simulate that situation. In physics you often run into problems that are too laborious to compute by hand. In this module you’ll learn how to use your computer instead. </td>

### Scientific Programming 2 (Level 4 - Level 6)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Level 4</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>MONOPOLY</b>. When playing Monopoly, a starting player's advantage seems unfair. To verify, you could play many (millions) real games, but this would take way too much time. Instead, you'll write a computer simulation. This also allows you to experiment with game adjustments to make it fair. You're doing all this for a board game, but this simulation principle applies to various scientific fields (economy, chemistry, biology...).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 5</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>COMPLEXITY</b>. What is an efficient algorithm? When you want to run large simulations, analyze large dataset, or any other computationally intensive task, writing efficient algorithms could in some cases mean the difference between a run time of a couple of minutes or of weeks. The theory of computational complexity gives you a way to reason about the efficiency of algorithms and make them run (much) faster.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 6</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>SURVIVAL</b>. Python is very popular for analyzing and processing data. And Pandas is an important reason why. Pandas is the most used Python package for handling data. You will learn how to use this package to analyze and visualize geographical data.</td>

### Data Processing (Level 7 - Level 11)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Level 7</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>POPULATIONS</b>. Predator-prey simulations are models used in ecology and computer science to study the dynamics between populations of predators and their prey within an ecosystem. What's particularly interesting about these simulations is how they can reveal emergent patterns and complex behaviors that arise from relatively simple rules. Ta make it easier to program such a simulation you will learn a programming technique called object oriented programming (OOP).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 8</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>ACQUISITION</b>. What was the best year for movies? This is often debated on the internet, for example [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/12/28/feature/what-was-the-best-year-in-movie-history/), [here](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/film-history-best-year-1999-star-wars-matrix-fight-club-sixth-sense-a9036911.html), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5m6jrp/best_year_for_movies/) and [here](https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/10-movies-prove-1994-was-best-year-film-history). You're going to write a bot that extracts information from websites to find an answer to this question. This process is called web-scraping. When you're doing research it's often the case that the data is out there on the internet, but no-one went through the effort to collect for you in way that you can directly use it. In that case you will need to know how to acquire this data yourself. </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 9</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>TRANSFORMATION</b>. Does a restaurant pass health code inspections? Could you gauge this by analyzing reviews of this restaurant? You will use information from two different data sources (Yelp and the Washington State Department of Health) to answer these questions. The problem is (as you will see quite often when analyzing data), there is no straightforward way to combine the two data sources. They were never made to be used together, so you will need to transform the datasets to be used together.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 10</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>DATABASES</b>. When working with really large amounts of data, you typically wont store it in simple (text) files on your computer. You'd use something like a relational database. To get information from a database you'll need a specific language called Structured Query Language (SQL). You're going to practice SQL by solving a mystery... </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 11</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>FINAL PROJECT</b>. Do you have data from your own studies or research that you would like to analyze? Do this with our help for the final project of this course. The goal here is to work on something that you find interesting and care about. </td>
