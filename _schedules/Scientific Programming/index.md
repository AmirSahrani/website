# Scientific Programming



## Levels

### Scientific Programming 1 (Level 1 - Level 3)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Level 0 </td><td colspan="3"> Python Installation </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 1</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>ALGORITHMS</b>. Learn to think like a computer. Things that we intuitively know how to do, like drawing a pyramid or computing change for a payment, is hard to get a computer to do right. In this module you’ll learn how to break down such intuitive problems into steps that even a computer can understand.
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMBERS</b>. How do you know if a number is a prime number? Number theory is the science about properties of numbers. In this mathematically oriented module you create a series of programs that compute this and other properties of numbers. No math knowledge required for this module. (You will learn some, though)

      <b>Level 2</b> (choose one of the modules)
    </td><td>
      <b>TEXT</b>. Natural language processing is the science of making a computer understand (something about) natural human language. You will learn how you can get a computer to understand the sentiment of tweets. Is the tone of the tweet positive or negative?
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>NUMERICAL INTEGRATION</b>. In many scientific fields you need to determine the surface area under a function. Integration is a mathematical tool for doing so. However this tool doesn't always work and in such cases we can use numerical integration techniques to let the computer do the work for us. You will learn two important techniques for numerical integration.

    <td> Level 3 (no choice)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>BIG-DATA</b>. In this module you will learn to work with data. You will, for example, analyze weather from the Netherlands and answer questions like: When was the first heat-wave? What was the longest freezing period? </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> Bonus (this module is optional)</td><td colspan="3"> <b>MOVEMENT</b>. What happens if you dig a tunnel from one side to the other side of the planet and you fall in this tunnel? In this module you’re going to simulate that situation. In physics you often run into problems that are too laborious to compute by hand. In this module you’ll learn how to use your computer instead. </td>
